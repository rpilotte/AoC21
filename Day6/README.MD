# AoC 2021: Day 6
Excel still works for Day 6

## Explanations:
This is a "working" solution without any manual search. All you need is to correctly import the data and then read the solution.

## How it works
Data import is made simple, but as first line is CSV and cards are delimited, import is global for all and some misalignment was possible. 
The basic idea is that all lantern fish grow at the same time. Counting the population by class age is easier.
So is the solution!

## Instructions:
Paste raw data, as copied from your puzzle input, in “DATA IN” the sheet at CELL A1
Goto to the “Calculation” page and read the solutions at cell N1 for part 1 and N2 for part 2
